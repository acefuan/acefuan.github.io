                        With the increase in greenhouse gases, temperature has rised making each decade warmer than the previous. Due to that many disastrous events have surfaced as a result, these events 
                        include the following.

                            <p>Due to the raise in temperature, the Arctic sea ice is melting at an accelerating speed. It is told that the Arctic sea ice shrinks by 12.6% per decade and it was researched in 2006 that the sea ice 
                                would complete dissapear in 2040, but recent research shows that the dissaperance of the arctic can happen as soon as 2035. Not only does this impact the inhabitants living there, on a more global awarning state it has caused 
                                the sea level to rise. If the meltage of the Arctic sea ice does not slow down and sea level continues to rise, this will pose a great danger to coastal and islandic areas causing the sinkage of islands, 
                                floods and storm surges. If the Arctic sea ice complete melts, the global sea level could potentially rise by 6 meters.

                            <p>Climate change has turned the tide of wildfires in many various ways such as more lengthy wildfire seasons, more contagious wildfires and more numbers of wildfires. Wildfires are much common during drought seasons, where 
                                there is a lack of precipitation. For instance, the Australian Bushfire caused by the extreme dry season that started three years ago of the incident. The wildfire burnt million hectares of lands 
                                which has destroyed the ecosystem, degraded the forest soil and cause major air pollution. Furthermore, the burning of these lands increases the amount of greenhouse gases which can lead to the worsening 
                                of climate change. To recover the lands that are loss to wildfires may take years on end and we may see more instances of wildires to exist if we do not make a change.

                            <p>Hurricanes are huge, swirling storms. Unlike a normal rainstorm, the speed of wind is much greater in a hurricane and can cause extreme damages. Hurricanes can be classified by 
                                different categories ranging from 1 to 5. It is formed when a thunderstorm meets high wind speeds from warm sea surfaces. Aftermaths may include floods, damaged power lines, damaged properties, and it can also be life threatening. 
                                Due to climate change and the increase in global temperature, the rate of evaporation
                                 to form cloud storms have intensified and the sea surface has become much warmer causing an increase amount of the occurrences of hurricanes and higher intensity hurricanes such as category 4 and 5 
                                 are much more common now than before.

                                 of diseases, economic loses, etc. Climate change has increased the events of a drought due to warmer temperatures and greater evaporation rates that reduces the surface water levels. Trends of longer periods of

                         A rise in global hunger and poor nutrition as an effect. Environmental changes in the arctic has effected food suplies from herding, hunting, and fishing. The increase in heat waves has

                        Climate impacts are already harming health, through air pollution, disease, extreme weather events, forced displacement, pressures on mental health, and increased hunger and 
                        poor nutrition in places where people cannot grow or find sufficient food. Every year, environmental factors take the lives of around 13 million people. Changing weather patterns 
                        are expanding diseases, and extreme weather events increase deaths and make it difficult for health care systems to keep up.

                    <p>
                        As well as its serious impact on the environment and people, climate change is one of the biggest threats to economic stability. 
                        Climate change increases the factors that put and keep people in poverty. Floods may sweep away urban slums, destroying homes and livelihoods. Heat can make it difficult to work in outdoor jobs.
                         Water scarcity may affect crops. Over the past decade (2010 – 2019), weather-related events displaced an estimated 23.1 million people on average each year, leaving many more vulnerable to poverty.
                          Most refugees come from countries that are most vulnerable and least ready to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
