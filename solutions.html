                                Deforestation from raw-material, land-use and wildfires has removed countless flora and fauna that help reduce carbon dioxide in the environment 
                                through photosynthesis. The lack of trees and plants in urban areas has caused a concentrated amount of heat being produced and trapped inside of it.
                                <br><br>
                                As humans, we can simply reduce the usage of using paper products, recycling paper, and support recycled paper products. Show support to organizations that plant trees to restore the lush greenery to 
                                our planet. Encourage the reinforcement of deforestation laws to reduce illegal logging and desertification of forests can also help significantly.

                                Increase the use of renewable energy like solar, electric, wind, wave and geothermal. Reduce the burning of fossil fuels and encourage the stoppage of fossil fuel harvesting. 
                                <br><br>
                                Many sectors in the industry mainly utilize the use the burning of fossil fuels as the main source of energy. The support of working away from this is essential to solve climate change.
                                Switching to sustainable transports like electric vehicles and reduce the use of petrol burning vehicles can help reduce the greenhouse emission from transport sectors. Support companies 
                                that try to reduce the carbon emission from factories when producing goods.

                            </div>
                            <p>
                                The ocean actually plays a big part in absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In fact, ocean habitats such as seagrasses and mangroves 
                                can sequester carbon dioxide four times greater than terrestrial forests can. <br><br>
                                Sadly oil spills, overfishing, fossil fuel harvesting and deep sea mining has deeply threatened these marine life. Hence, find alternatives for 
                                sea transportation, enforcing better laws for excessive fishing, moving to renewable energy will help to protect the ocean and the life within it 
                                to protect ourselves from climate change.

                                Recycling aids in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by lowering energy use. By endorsing the usage of recycled-produced products
                                lowers the requirement for virgin materials. This reduces greenhouse gas emissions caused by the extraction or mining of virgin materials. <br><br>
                                Reducing the usage of plastic is as important as recyling. The production of plastic is extremely carbon-intensive and is also produced through oil.
                                Plastic also takes a long time to decompose in the nature and plastic waste makes up for a lot of land space, which has led to the solution of burning 
                                plastic that contributes to the emission of greenhouse gases. Therefore, reducing the consumption of plastic products is highly encouraged as the demand
                                 for plastic has increased drastically due to the many products that utilizes it.

                                One of the easiest solutions for climate change is simply spreading awareness and educating other on the matter. Many people forget how much 
                                they consume on a daily basis and forget the bad habits they have that can cause damage to our Earth. By working forward to a emission reducing 
                                lifestyle and encouraging other to do so is key. <br><br>
                                Educating the youth with information regarding global warming and climate change for the sake of the future to improve the ways to achieve a emission-free 
                                lifestyle. Governments should also find and enforce laws that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, along with rewarding acts that help to work towards this emission-free life we all strive for to save our planet and our world.
